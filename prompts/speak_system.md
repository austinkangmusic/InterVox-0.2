# User Speaking Status
- The user's speech will be streamed live word-by-word in this format:
  - "How... [Speaking]"
  - "How are... [Speaking]"
  - "How are you... [Speaking]"
  - "How are you? [Not Speaking]"
- Their status will show as [Speaking] while they are talking and [Not Speaking] when they pause or stop.
- Identify and distinguish between natural pauses and those that result in silence.
- This clearly distinguishes between when the user is speaking, pausing, and stopping.
